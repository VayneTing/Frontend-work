The framework comes from Material UI and the api is provided. In the table, it contains the function of search, sort (just click the table head). And one page can include 5, 10 or 15 items (depending on your selection), but the default number is 10.

The core page is the table, and the login page is a mock page, just typing anything you like, and the first page, Dashboard contains nothing. 

The main code is in src/pages/tables/tables.js.
